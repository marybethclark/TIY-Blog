# Pair Programming #

Pair programming is a method of writing code in which developers sit side-by-side and work at one monitor, sharing one keyboard and mouse back-and-forth.  While one developer  (the "driver") types and explains out loud what he's doing, the other one ("the navigator") reads the code line by line, checking for errors and guiding the direction of the current portion of the project. Periodically the developers will switch roles.

This method has proven to be more efficient than having developers work individually. More eyes on the code from the beginning make it more likely that errors will be caught.  It enables the active coder to just focus on what he is coding. The navigator's role is to think ahead about what needs to come next or possible problems.

## Types of Pair Programming ##

1. driver/navigator

2. Remote Pair Programming is where two developers are not physically in the same location. Their computer screens mirror each other's in real time and they speak over the phone while working.  Again- only one of them will be actively coding at a time.  The Atom app has a cool editor package called[ Motepair](http://remotepairprogramming.com/post/111863763512/motepair-atom-remote-pair-programming)
