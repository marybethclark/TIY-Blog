Growth Mindset
==============
---

In traditional education, the *"fixed"* mindset has been the norm. This mindset is based on the belief that your traits, your skills, your intelligence are all fixed from birth, set in stone, unable to be changed, basically. If we compared it to the nature versus nurture argument, the fixed mindset would correspond with nature. That is to say- it's in our genes, prewired. The fixed mindset focuses on output and achievement (i.e. grades & awards.) In the [middle school where I taught 6th grade science and math](http://www.chatham.k12.nc.us/mbpms) ,we publicly recognized students for their high grades. They received certificates at a huge assembly for making A or A/B honor roll. The problem with this mindset is that it makes people reluctant to take risks or open themselves up to the potential for failure. If their worth is measured by success, why would they ever want to try something at which they might not be successful? 

There is a new mindset, known as the [“Growth Mindset"](http://mindsetonline.com/whatisit/about/)  Growth mindset differs from fixed mindset in that, unlike Fixed Mindset where your traits and skills are fixed from birth, this mindset believes that your traits, your skills, and your intelligence can be developed over time. Rather than focusing on output and achievement, grades, and awards, this mindset focuses on effort and practice. Studies on the brain have shown that when you push yourself out of your comfort zone **your brain creates new and stronger neural pathways**. You are growing more brain. *You physiologically make yourself smarter.*

 In classrooms where students are praised for their process, rather than their outcome, they tend to be more willing to take risks and step outside of their comfort zone. They are praised for such things as 

* their process
* their effort 
* the strategies they use 
* their perseverance and improvement
* their ability to stay focused


This approach has been shown to promote a love of learning and improve student confidence and happiness. It also **improves achievement**, which, despite being a fixed mindset goal, is still a worthy goal. (It's also a measure by which public school teachers are evaluated!!)

 I used this growth mindset technique with my sixth-graders.  Whenever they would come to me frustrated that they didn't understand a concept, I would reframe it for them: “You can't do it YET.” “You don't understand it YET.”

But I haven't always pushed myself out of *my* comfort zone.  As a preteen, I wanted to be able to play the piano. What I didn't recognize in myself was that I didn't necessarily want to *LEARN* how to play the piano. I just wanted to be able to *DO* it - without the effort, without the practice, without the time, without the failing.  So I didn't practice very much. And as a result I didn't make much progress. My lack of progress was un-motivating and frustrating, and so I gave up.

 As an adult, I have experienced the miraculous miracle of the growth mindset. I've been [practicing yoga](http://www.cathyholtyoga.com/about-studio) for over 10 years. When I began, I didn't like it. I wasn't flexible, and the poses were confusing and uncomfortable. Why would anyone choose to do this? But I had paid money for a series of 12 classes, so I stuck with it. Over time, I came to dread downward dog less. (It’s still not my favorite pose, but I have come to appreciate what it has to offer.)  I noticed that my flexibility increased, my strength increased, and now I rely on my yogic breathing automatically when I need to calm myself. I discovered that I am actually hyper flexible. I'm proud of myself for sticking it out, for pushing past the time when I wasn't good at it, and it wasn't fun.

At [The Iron Yard](http://landing.theironyard.com/landing/durham-db4e/?gclid=CjwKEAjwsYW6BRCTzvu5y8DPhi0SJABnGLlHoNxXKHirDxRFBpr32dhNLyvQuorEkszqmSz2XrTqvxoCTOTw_wcB), after just one week, I can tell that I'm going to need to post growth mindset-related mantras all over the place, where I can see them, and be motivated. As a biology major, it really resonates with me that neurologically, this method works. If I push myself past my comfort zone, I am building a better brain. Yesterday, when I was working on our HTML/CSS homework assignment, I had a "tiny victories” list going. Every time I had even a small success, I wrote it down. Some of the things I noted were 

*  got one heart to show up 
*  font size changed successfully 
*  centering the title of my page
*  added border radius to card 

At this stage in my journey, those little steps are a big deal to me. And they keep me motivated. Baby steps. If I can just focus on my tiny victories, it will motivate me to continue to try the scary stuff.

 **Practice makes progress.**
