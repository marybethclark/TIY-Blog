Before coming to The Iron Yard, I didn't know that programmers are able to automate so much of their code by using "devices" such as loops.  They can set it up to run through long sets of data and give it precise instructions for what to look for and when to stop.  And I knew about html, a little, but I didn't realize that parts of the html, classes for example, are essential for the JavaScript to be able to do what you want on a webpage.

One challenge I've faced since starting the program is not comparing myself to my classmates with regard to my level of understanding and skill as a junior developer.  I realize that all of us come to TIY with different levels of experience with coding and computers.  My family got our first computer, an Apple IIe, when I was a senior in high school.  So to compare myself to classmates who  grew up with them is unrealistic.  When I compare myself today with myself from 5 weeks ago, I am quite impressed.  I've learned a ton!   While driving home last Friday, I had an "Oh no!  We only have 4 more weeks of lecture!" moment.  But then I thought to myself, "Yeah, but look at how much you learned in the last 5 weeks.  Just imagine how far you can go in almost that amount of time again."  My fear is that I won't get a suitable job if I don't understand coding well enough.  I don't care if I don't have the same level of understanding or skill as my classmates.  I just don't want to let my family down.  I have to get a job that pays better than what I was making as a public school teacher.  (In NC, that shouldn't be too hard, right??)

How am I overcoming this challenge?  Rhonda and I have good conversations about it.  She gives great pep talks and we laugh about all the cool jargon we now understand.  Being of similar ages really helps.  I journal about my feelings and talk to my husband.  And I keep a list of "tiny victories" that remind me that I can now do stuff that I didn't even know existed before joining TIY.  I think I'm making progress on this front.  It's been a week since I cried in frustration.  I no longer get a sickening feeling when I can't figure out the daily timed challenge.  I just give it my best effort and pay close attention when classmates who did solve it explain how.  Baby steps.  One day at a time...
